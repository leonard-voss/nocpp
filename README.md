# nocpp (No Charge Point Protocol)
## :clipboard: Description
NOCPP is the result of a project at the Ostwestfalen-Lippe University of Applied Sciences. It was developed by students of the Computer Engineering course. The client for this project is the company rt-solutions.de, which provides advice and solutions in information and OT security.

NOCPP is an application for targeted pentesting of a charging station. The OCPP connection between the Charge Point (CP) and the Charge Station Management System (CSMS) is used as an attack parameter. In addition to various selected fuzzing attack scenarios, information gathering is also implemented. New attack scenarios can be easily implemented using a state machine. The results of the attacks, configurations and tests are exported in a results PDF.

This project is based on the Open-Source OCPP implementation in Python by The Mobility House, which you can find [here](https://github.com/mobilityhouse/ocpp).

## :floppy_disk: Charge Point support

Currently OCPP 1.6-J (JSON) is the only supported version.

The application was tested on a charging station from the manufacturer Weidm√ºller, model AC Smart Advanced.

## :warning: System Requirements

Please make sure you use Python version 3.10 or higher.  

This application requires a modified version of the ocpp and the websockets libraries.
Both extensions are included in this repository.

## :white_check_mark: Getting Started

To execute the application, run Main.py.
You can use the following console arguments:
<ul>
  <li>skip-websocket-config (Skips the manual WebSocket setup and uses default values. This argument blocks the set arguments.)</li>
  <li>set-ip-address=[ipv4-address] (Set a specific IPv4 Address, uses default if the specified address is invalid.)</li>
  <li>set-port=[port] (Set a specific port, uses default if the specified port is invalid.)</li>
</ul>

## :bomb: Attack Szenarios

NOCPP uses various attack techniques, including inserting different data types and data values, as well as code injection. Please note that the effectiveness of this tool varies depending on the charging station. NOCPP recognizes successful system requests as well as error messages. In the event of a connection interruption (timeout), this is noted and the program is safely shut down. Due to the asynchronous program structure, this process can take significantly longer than the generation of the result PDF.
